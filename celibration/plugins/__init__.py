""" Currently, this library supports three types of plugins:
    - Calibration Difference Functions
    - Calibration Models
    - Data Transformations

Feel free to either use existing plugins or write your own. In case of the latter, please make sure you
adhere the structure of the type of plugin that you are willing to write. Lastly, provide your own plugins to the library by mentioning the folderpath with either the "-pfs" or "--plugins_folders" argument.
